# youtube-dl-gui
C# WPF gui for youtube-dl

A personal learning project.  

Wraps some of the features of youtube-dl / yt-dlp.0

### Why should you use this?
You probably shouldn't. There are better youtube-dl GUI's out there that have much more features and development.  
This is okay if you only need to download youtube videos and twitch VODs, as those are the only websites I have personally tested for my personal use.  

Each website potentially has it's own quirks for what youtube-dl outputs which makes it difficult to cover all edge cases without thorough testing.
